Develop a chat room with C socket (inter-process communication interface) that can allow different people on network (local) join the same chat room and chat with each other. Different people can be different instances of the terminal.

Current progress: Allowing multiple users to enter messages and display these messages in other users' chatrooms (termial screen). 
Future development direction: Allowing user to input name (in client.c), server to respond, and display corresponding names with messages in the live chat room.
